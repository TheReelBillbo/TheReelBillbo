- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheReelBillbo
- 👀 whoami:  By trade I am an IT Manager for a MSP in Northern Nevada.  
      I started working at an ISP as a tech support agent in 1998 and have worked in the Information Technology field full-time since 1999.  
      I started out using BBS back in the 80s and browsing hacking forums as a kid and found it really interesting but never really pursued it.  
      I recently found myself growing bored with IT and poking aroung on YT I started watching CTF videos - following along.  
      I am now working to obtain more training and will soon make the switch into CyberSecurity.  
      Outside of working and learning, I am a husband, grandpa, furbaby daddy, veteran, backpacker, and gaming nerd.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python and Basic PenTesting with @TheCyberMentor
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things Cybersecurity. @SimplyCyber #TeamSC
