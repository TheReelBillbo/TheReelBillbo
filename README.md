- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheReelBillbo
- 👀 whoami:  By trade I am an IT Manager for a MSP in Northern Nevada.  
      I started working at an ISP as a tech support agent in 1998 and have worked in the Information Technology field full-time since 1999.  
      I started out using BBS back in the 90s and browsing hacking forums as a kid and found it really interesting but never really pursued it.  
      Over the years, I have begun to find IT Support thankless and unfulfilling.  So about a year ago, I started watching CTF videos, then I startd following along.  
      I am now working on my own YouTube Channel to help folks make that jump and level up their career.  Come check out @Tech2Threat and level up your career.  
      Outside of working and learning, I am a husband, grandpa, furbaby daddy, veteran, handyman, backpacker, and gaming nerd.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things Cybersecurity. @SimplyCyber #TeamSC
